# Insult Classification in a Social Media Comment

Objective of this project is to detect if a comment from an online conversation can be considered insulting to another participant in the conversation. The idea is to create a generalizable single-class classifier which could operate in a near real-time mode. In this project I build a system that can detect whether or not any given comment is insulting by building a machine learning system.

In addition to just building a classifier this project also test different classifier - Linear & Non-Linear and decide which might be the best classifier for the purpose.


**Note:** This project is based around *Detecting Insults in Social Commentary* hosted on Kaggle by Imperium.
